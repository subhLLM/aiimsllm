Lt Governor inaugurates 32nd International Conference of Indian Association of Palliative Care at AIIMS Jammu Media SAMBA: Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha inaugurated the 32nd International Conference of the Indian Association of Palliative Care (IAPC), at AIIMS Jammu. More than 800 national and international delegates will join deliberations to foster advancements and innovations in palliative care for quality of life for patients diagnosed with terminal illness. The three-day conference is being organised by IAPC J K Chapter and AIIMS, Jammu. In his keynote address, the Lieutenant Governor exhorted the experts to keep Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) up to date and be more sensitive towards the needs of individuals diagnosed with life-threatening disease, well-being of families, alleviate pain and suffering and provide spiritual support. The Lieutenant Governor asked the private sector to work with the administration to set up Palliative care centres in backward and remote areas.  In J K, the administration in 2022 had set up 10-bed state-of-the-art Palliative and Geriatric Care Wards in all the districts. We have tried to bridge urban-rural divide to certain extent. Our aim is to deliver medical and psychological support at people s doorstep,  he said. The Lieutenant Governor emphasised that all the experts and the Indian Association of Palliative Care should work together to promote multi-sectoral partnerships so that a human resource pool of trained care-givers is made available.  In Palliative care, health ecosystem and healthcare professionals have a moral responsibility to reduce the pain and suffering of patients. Apart from adopting innovative approach to pain management, health care professionals at all levels should be given training for continuity in the care of such patients,  the Lieutenant Governor said. The Lieutenant Governor made valuable suggestions for seamless integration of curative care and Palliative care in health ecosystem. He suggested that uniform SoPs may be prepared for community awareness, palliative support and pain management at the district level. Palliative Care system is constantly evolving and we need to work on strategic framework, SoPs and its effective implementation, he said. The Lieutenant Governor further highlighted the need to bridge the gap in healthcare facilities and special services for the ageing population.  By 2050, 20.8  of India s total population will be above 60 years of age. This increase in the elderly population requires us to develop a strong care economy to ensure that our elders can live healthy, dignified and fulfilling lives,  the Lieutenant Governor said. He also suggested developing a comprehensive healthcare package which includes regular check-ups, geriatric care, mental health support and palliative care. On the occasion, the Lieutenant Governor inaugurated Radiotherapy Oncology and Operation Theatre Complex at AIIMS Jammu.

Lt Governor inaugurates 32nd International Conference of Indian Association of Palliative Care at AIIMS Jammu Media SAMBA: Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha inaugurated the 32nd International Conference of the Indian Association of Palliative Care (IAPC), at AIIMS Jammu. More than 800 national and international delegates will join deliberations to foster advancements and innovations in palliative care for quality of life for patients diagnosed with terminal illness. The three-day conference is being organised by IAPC J K Chapter and AIIMS, Jammu. In his keynote address, the Lieutenant Governor exhorted the experts to keep Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) up to date and be more sensitive towards the needs of individuals diagnosed with life-threatening disease, well-being of families, alleviate pain and suffering and provide spiritual support. The Lieutenant Governor asked the private sector to work with the administration to set up Palliative care centres in backward and remote areas.  In J K, the administration in 2022 had set up 10-bed state-of-the-art Palliative and Geriatric Care Wards in all the districts. We have tried to bridge urban-rural divide to certain extent. Our aim is to deliver medical and psychological support at people s doorstep,  he said. The Lieutenant Governor emphasised that all the experts and the Indian Association of Palliative Care should work together to promote multi-sectoral partnerships so that a human resource pool of trained care-givers is made available.  In Palliative care, health ecosystem and healthcare professionals have a moral responsibility to reduce the pain and suffering of patients. Apart from adopting innovative approach to pain management, health care professionals at all levels should be given training for continuity in the care of such patients,  the Lieutenant Governor said. The Lieutenant Governor made valuable suggestions for seamless integration of curative care and Palliative care in health ecosystem. He suggested that uniform SoPs may be prepared for community awareness, palliative support and pain management at the district level. Palliative Care system is constantly evolving and we need to work on strategic framework, SoPs and its effective implementation, he said. The Lieutenant Governor further highlighted the need to bridge the gap in healthcare facilities and special services for the ageing population.  By 2050, 20.8  of India s total population will be above 60 years of age. This increase in the elderly population requires us to develop a strong care economy to ensure that our elders can live healthy, dignified and fulfilling lives,  the Lieutenant Governor said.

On the occasion, the Lieutenant Governor inaugurated Radiotherapy Oncology and Operation Theatre Complex at AIIMS Jammu.
